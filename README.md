# smart-dustbin-garbage-management-system

IoT and Machine Learning-Based Household Waste Management System
In this project, I developed an innovative waste management system leveraging IoT and machine learning (KNN) to enhance efficiency in waste collection within residential societies. Achieving an impressive accuracy of 96.875%, the system utilizes smart dustbins that monitor waste levels in real time and alert relevant authorities when thresholds are met.

Key Features:

Automated Alerts: Sends notifications to maintenance personnel for timely waste collection, reducing delays and improving sanitation.
Enhanced Public Health: By ensuring regular waste disposal, the system minimizes disease risk and contributes to a healthier living environment.
Data-Driven Insights: Analyzed waste generation patterns using machine learning algorithms to predict future waste levels, allowing for proactive management strategies.
Support for Swachh Bharat Mission: Aligns with national sanitation goals, promoting cleanliness and responsible waste management within communities.
This project not only streamlines waste disposal processes but also fosters a sustainable approach to urban living.
